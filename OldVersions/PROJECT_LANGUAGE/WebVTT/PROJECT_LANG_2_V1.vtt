00:15:003 --> 00:52:240
<v>system</v>I decided to make WebVTT the second project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Anime_Studio/OpenAnime) as WebVTT is the main subtitle language used on this project, coming second in usage to Markdown. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
