# OpenAnime from [Anime Studio](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Anime_Studio/)

## About

The OpenAnime project is a community-led Anime project where royalty free, Anime media series are developed. They are free for all usage, and are continuously developed.

OpenAnime is a project similar to the Blender foundations community movie series, except instead of being made in Blender, it is made in Anime Studio. 

There will be multiple events going on at once. The OpenAnime project aims to include only Anime that is royalty free and copyleft, and every entry in the series has to be fully distributable and remixable.

## Restrictive license revoked

The OpenAnime project was my accepted compromise for not putting a restrictive license for this project. The original plan was to disallow copyrighted works from being created with the software. I knew this was too strict, and I agreed that a constant event that promoted open source, royalty free, and public domain Anime projects would be the best solution.
